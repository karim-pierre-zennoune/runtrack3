  "I don't get it, Tyrell. How can it not know what it is? On Rachael not knowing that she is a replicant.",
  "Memories, you're talking about memories.",
  "I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was being so charming.",
  "Sushi. That's what my ex-wife used to call me. \"Cold fish.\"",
  "The charmer's name was Gaff, I'd seen him around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That gibberish he talked was city speak, gutter talk. A mishmash of Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a translator, I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going to make it easier for him.",
  "\"Skin jobs\". That's what Bryant called Replicants. In history books he's the kind of cop who used to call black men \"niggers\".",
  "I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out.",
  "Whatever was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales.",
  "And family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.",
  "Leon's pictures had to be as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a Replicant would collect photos. Maybe they were like Rachael... they needed memories.",
  "The report would be \"routine retirement of a Replicant\", which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. There it was again... feeling in myself... for her... for Rachael.",
  "Gaff had been there, and let her live. Four years, he figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachael was special: no termination date.",
  "You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?",
  "Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave."
